This tutorial is broken down into multiple parts that are easy to digest.  Where possible I will include a video as well as links to the completed application components.

This tutorial is based in part on [Angular 4 CRUD Example](http://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-4-crud-example) by Arvind Rai. I chose this article because I was struggling with finding a good example of using observables for CRUD operations. After reading the article and playing around with a few things thought was pretty good basis for creating this tutorial.

While observables were important, I also wanted to provide an example with a few more features. The key features I wanted to highlight with the Ionic application are:

* Observables as a way to listen to changes to data as well as changes to form controls
* [Pull to Refresh](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/components/refresher/Refresher/)
* [Sliding List Items](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/components/item/ItemSliding/)
* [In App Browser](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/in-app-browser/)
